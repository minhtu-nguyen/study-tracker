This is a paragraph. Don't put tabs or spaces in front of your paragraphs.

To create a line break or new line (<br>), end a line with two or more spaces, and then type return.  
First line with two spaces after.  
And this is the second line.

I just love **bold text**.

Italicized text is the *cat's meow*.

You can ~~strikethrough words~~ by putting a horizontal line through the center of them.

I need to highlight these ==very important words==.

> Blockquotes can contain multiple paragraphs. Add a > on the blank lines between the paragraphs.
>> Blockquotes can be nested. Add a >> in front of the paragraph you want to nest.
